<h3> A Serious Version - If I were you, I would skip this part :) </h3>

<p> When I first entered college, I was majoring in German language. Although I quickly memorized the genus of nouns and conjugation of verbs and scored a straight A's, I felt my talent lies in elsewhere. Driven by my keen passion for quantitative disciplines, I changed my major to mathematics. Later on, I sought opportunities to apply my course-learned knowledge to real-world practice.</p> 

<p> I first joined a quantitative hedge fund where I researched multi-factor stock selection strategies. I also paid close attention to utilizing some numerical tricks, such as using non-linear functions to transform factors to reduce the correlation of return time series between my strategy’s and thousands of others’ in the fund's library. Besides, I once suggested assessing the performance of stock price forecast and re-estimating the cost of short selling. The fund manager highly valued my ideas and assigned a team to improve the back-testing framework.</p> 

<p> Later, I was among the two students selected from a cohort of hundreds to work at the Sales and Trading Department at CICC, a top investment bank in China. I not only conducted quantitative work including automated data processing and modeling but also explained models in plain language to clients with little quantitative knowledge. From raw data to modeling to the presentation, I had the opportunity to develop a holistic view of the business. </p> 

<p> Afterward, I joined the Derivatives Department at Shanghai Futures Exchange, where I performed wrangling and visualization on real trading data of options, and forecast volatility and its distribution. Besides, I independently worked on the project of index design and implementation.</p> 

<p> These experiences made me more determined to further my study in quantitative finance. So here I am, being an MQF student at UW. This summer, I am going to join the Porfolio Construction Group at one of the largest pension plans in Canada.</p>
